- Source Code for the game:
  - It is written in the Visual Studio 2019 Community IDE
  - The external library that is used to make this game is ALLEGRO 5
- If you are interested in running this application, then DOWNLOAD:
  - Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16
    - I strongly recommend you to download Visual Studio 2017 Express as Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition has limitations on how many people can contribute to a project
  - If you want the Visual Studio 2017 Express version (there is no 2019 express): https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_WDExpress.exe
